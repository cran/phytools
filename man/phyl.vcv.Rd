\usage{
phyl.vcv(X, C, lambda)
}
\arguments{
	\item{lambda}{value for \eqn{\lambda} transformation.}
	\item{X}{data matrix.}
	\item{C}{matrix containing the height above the root of each pair of species in the tree. Typically this will have been produced by calling \code{\link[ape]{vcv.phylo}}.}
}
\description{
	Internal function for \code{\link{phyl.pca}}.
}
\details{
	Primarily designed as an internal function for \code{\link{phyl.pca}}; \code{phyl.vcv} can be used to compute the phylogenetic trait variance-covariance matrix given a phylogenetic VCV, \eqn{\lambda}, and a data matrix. 
	
	This function should not be confused with \code{\link[ape]{vcv.phylo}} in the \pkg{ape} package (although one of the objects returned is the output of \code{vcv.phylo}).
	
	Note that prior to \pkg{phytools} 2.1-0 the matrix \code{X} was not sorted to match the rows of \code{C} since that was assumed to have been done in the function calling \code{phyl.vcv} internally; however, I recently discovered that this had caused the function to be used incorrectly resulting in a paper correction. This is now fixed such that \code{X} is checked for row names and (if present) \code{C} is sorted to match the rows of \code{X}. Hopefully this does not cause any problems for other functions using \code{phyl.vcv}!

\value{
	A list containing three elements, as follows: \code{C}, the matrix \code{vcv.phylo} transformed by \code{lambda}; \code{R}, the among trait variance-covariance matrix for the data in \code{X}; and \code{alpha}, a vector of ancestral states at the root node of the tree.
