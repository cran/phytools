\title{Compute the relative frequencies of state changes along edges}
\usage{
edgeProbs(trees)
}
\arguments{
	\item{trees}{an object of class \code{"multiSimmap"} containing a sample of trees that are identical in topology & branch lengths with different stochastically mapped character histories.}
}
\description{
	This function computes the relative frequencies of character state changes along edges from a sample of stochastically mapped character histories. This function assumes that all trees in the sample differ only in their mapped histories & not at all in topology or branch lengths. Note that it only asks whether the starting and ending states of the edge differ in a particular way, and thus ignores multiple-hits along a single edge.
}
\value{
	The object that is returned is a matrix with the state changes & the relative frequency of each state change. Rows are in the order of the matrix \code{edge} for any of the mapped trees.
